1. Never ask me to deploy firebase functions manually, stage it for deployment and ask me only to press the 'run command' button

2. Keep all firebase infro updated in a file, document structure changes and updates.

3. Firebase region for all functions is 'us-central1' and SDK version used is V2. All implementation should be done accordingly
