# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to


These rules aren't written in order of importance or preference, numbering is random.

1. UI rendering should be responsive and relative. Prioritise iPhones, Macbooks, iPads, PS5, Xbox but all in all it has to be truly cross-platform, it should 'respond' to the type of device, type of screen, type of inputs (Buttons vs Touch vs Keys). A single cohesive aesthetic across mobile, web, desktop, and console. Use responsive layouts and input-agnostic navigation (touch, mouse, controller) so the experience is intuitive everywhere.
2. Rangvaar, Scambodia UI/UX should be table top styled and themed
3. Aim for a “world-like” sense of exploration: dynamic visuals, layered interfaces, and fluid transitions.
4. Avoid overloading devices: keep animations and 3D elements optimized for minimal performance overhead.
5. Integrate chat, friend lists, social feeds, party invites, or any such engagement elements directly in the UI. Users should feel they’re part of a living community, not just loading solitary game pages.
6. Many features revolve around wagering, tournaments, or real-money transactions. Prioritize user confidence: incorporate clean forms, prominent call-to-action (CTA) buttons, clear confirmations, and feedback loops.

7. Brand Mood & Visual Direction :
- Look and feel :
Futuristic: Subtle neon glows, gradient backgrounds, modern iconography.
Vibrant, Yet Minimal: Let color highlights pop against neutral or dark backdrops. Keep overall layout uncluttered.
Slightly Playful: Rounded corners, dynamic micro-animations on hover/tap, and occasional gamified transitions (e.g., “loading progress bars” shaped like power bars).
Color Palette (Sample Concept) :
Primary: A dark neutral (#1D1D29 or #262630) for backgrounds.
Accent 1: Electric purple/blue (#6E44FF or #5373F3) for key CTAs.
Accent 2: Vibrant teal (#00C1D4) for secondary highlights or states.
Highlight: Pastel pink/orange (#F98CAB) for success messages, confetti, or social notifications.
Typography :
Choose a modern sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins) with robust weight options.
Headings in bolder weights for emphasis, body text in medium/regular for legibility.
Keep line spacing generous to avoid clutter, especially on smaller mobile screens.





Core User Flows & Interfaces :

3.1 Home / Main Hub
Purpose: Provide a panoramic “portal” to everything: wagering games, tournaments, events, social lounge, store, etc.
Layout:
Top Navbar: Brand logo, user avatar, notifications icon, and a quick access button to the primary user action (e.g., “Play Now” or “Join a Match”).
Central “Districts”: Large, card-like buttons or a map-inspired layout that leads to main sections (Wagering, Arcade, Tournaments, Social Lounge, Profile, etc.).
Scrolling Highlights: A horizontal or vertical carousel showcasing featured games, upcoming tournaments, live streams.
3.2 Game Browsing & Selection
Purpose: Let users discover, filter, and select from a library of available games or match types.

Visually highlight the “wager” aspect with clear disclaimers and an easy toggle between free-to-play or real-money (if supported).
3.4 In-Game UI Overlays (If Integrated)
Purpose: Minimal overlay for active match info—score, chat, bets, events.

Interaction & Micro-Interactions

Animated Transitions
Subtle page transitions, card flips, or background parallax to hint at a “living” environment.
Feedback & Confirmation
Snappy, color-coded toasts or modals for success (e.g., “Bet Placed!”) or errors.
Loading States
Use playful progress bars or spinner animations that align with the brand identity—think futuristic progress lines or glowing circles.


Responsive & Cross-Platform Considerations

Mobile
Bottom Nav: Thumb-friendly tab bar for quick access to Home, Matches, Social, Profile.
Condensed layouts with collapsible menus for filters, settings, or chat.
Desktop Web
Sidebar or Top Nav: More room for a vertical navigation panel with direct links to key sections.
Hover states, shortcuts for quick switching between active windows (e.g., a pinned chat window + match info).
Console
Controller-based navigation with clear focus indicators (highlighted cards or tabs).
Larger text and simplified layouts to accommodate TV viewing distance.
Scalable Architecture
Use consistent component libraries or frameworks that adapt fluidly to screen sizes and input methods.
